### Step-by-Step Installation

<Steps>
  ### Download the Extension

  Visit the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/vanascimento/herorabbit/releases/latest) and download the latest release.

  **Available formats:**

  - `herorabbit.zip` - Source code with build files
  - `herorabbit-dist.zip` - Pre-built extension (recommended)

  ### Extract Files

  Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your computer.

  **Important:** Keep the extracted folder in a permanent location, as Chrome needs to access it.

  ### Enable Developer Mode

  1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
  2. Toggle **Developer mode** in the top right corner
  3. You'll see additional options appear

  ### Load the Extension

  1. Click **Load unpacked** button
  2. Navigate to the extracted folder
  3. Select the folder containing the extension files
  4. Click **Select Folder**

  ### Verify Installation

  The extension should now appear in your extensions list with the name "Hero Rabbit".
</Steps>

### File Structure Requirements

For manual installation, ensure your extracted folder contains:

```
herorabbit/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json          # Extension manifest
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.html            # Popup interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background.js         # Background script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content.js           # Content script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/              # Images and styles
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _locales/            # Localization files
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
  If you're missing any of these files, the extension may not work properly.

</Callout>

## üöÄ Development Installation
